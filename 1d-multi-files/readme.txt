# Multiple files into build. This example shows loading 3 files into build.js.
# 2 are loaded via the 'entry' prop in webpack.config.js and 1 is loaded via a require() commonjs statement.

# --inline doesn't work with multiple entry files...
# does --inline work when using dev server/index.html?
$ webpack-dev-server
