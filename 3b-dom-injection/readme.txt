This demo shows what the (CSS) Style loader does to the dom.

All CSS in inlined via a <style> tag from a require() statement in app.js.

Note:
Fonts have been removed from bootstrap.css to keep the demo simpler.

1) have a package.json
2) $ npm install css-loader --save-dev
3) $ npm install style-loader --save-dev
3) $ npm install


# Then run either

# or
$ webpack-dev-server
